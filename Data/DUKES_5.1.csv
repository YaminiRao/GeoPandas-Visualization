(10)  These figures are the same as the electricity generated figures in Table 5.6 except that they exclude pumped storage production. Table 5.6 shows that electricity used on works is deducted to obtain electricity supplied. It is electricity supplied that is used to produce Chart 5.2 showing each fuel's share of electricity output (see paragraph 5.23).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
